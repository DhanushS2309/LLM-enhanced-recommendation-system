This project implements a scalable recommendation system by separating recommendation logic from language understanding. User behavior is modeled from transaction data using a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering captures patterns from user–item interactions, while content-based filtering uses precomputed semantic embeddings of product descriptions to identify similar items efficiently.

A Large Language Model is used only where language reasoning is required. It generates human-readable explanations for recommendations, summarizes user behavior into meaningful insights, and interprets natural-language search queries into structured filters. By keeping the LLM outside the core recommendation loop, the system remains fast, deterministic, and scalable while still providing intelligent and explainable recommendations suitable for real-world applications.
